    <strong>Welcome to my secrets!</strong>ü§ê
  </p>

  <p>
This project took me a lot of effort and time, like a lot! <br>
Although I found a lot of useful info in the Udemy Q&A section (some I implemented as well),
many hours of research needed to do how to fix one bug after another. Luckily for google,
stackoverflow (and some really helpful people on there) I can say I succeeded with this project!
The research for solutions many times were just a basic trial an error, which although can be really time consuming should
not be an underestimated method. There is a lot of joy in finding the right answer by yourself!
</p>

<p>
  Anyways, enough of me, let‚Äôs get to business and list what I learnt during this project.
  This could be very useful for me and others in the future. If you here from Udemy, I welcome you üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è! You are at the right spot to find the answers you seek (hopefully); I will list the most common issues others and I encountered trying to make this webapp working online. Now here is my github repo`s link you feel free to check my code. If you go into the theme.js or the styles.css I‚Äôm sure you will find a lot of clashes and a lot of ‚Äúnot so elegant‚Äù solutions. I`m a rookie, I own them! ahahah

<p><strong>How to make to app ready to be uploaded to Heroku</strong></p>
<p>1. Before we are pushing anything anywhere, we need change it from localhost where the app will listen.</p>
<div class="code">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/5483c563a506b4b1d9c1190c5e444f59.js"></script>
</div>
<p>2.Change from localDB to onlineDB</p>
<div class="code">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/e34b7e663c27f725ac8b5375f015db37.js"></script>
</div>
<p>3.	Add Procfile for Heroku so know what to do the project. <br> In CLI cd into folder, touch Procfile, start Procfile, write node app.js, save.</p>
<p>4. Edit packadge.json. Add extra lines:</p>
<div class="code">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/1e4a67c48064a5924d8a5a6dc1b2c0ba.js"></script>
</div>
<p>5. Add .gitignore-file so you won‚Äôt push unnecessary stuffs online such: /node_modules, npm-debug.log, DS_Store, /*.env ... </p>
<p>6. Add environmental variables to Heroku.<br> Create empty app, go settings, reveal config vars. Add the environmental variables there. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>Upload App to Heroku via Github</strong></p>
<p>The app should be ready to be uploaded. What I like to do is to push it to GitHub
  and in Heroku I connect to my GitHub repo and enable automatic deployments.
  It massively helps if you doing trial and error. Some point I had over 100+ commits doing trial and error, lol.
  Love it, only takes like 30 sec to redeploy the app.</p>
<p>1.	Create empty repo on github. <br>
2.	In CLI cd to the project folder<br>
3.	Git add . <br>
4.	Git commit -m ‚Äúinitial commit‚Äù <br>
5.	Git push https:// github.com/ YOURACCOUNT/ YOURREPO.git <br>
6.	Go Heroku and like I said, find the repo and deploy it. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>Suggestion for the mongoDB name/password</strong></p>
<p>I have a suggestion to make regarding the mongoDB password in the app.js.
  I rather used the environmental variable to store this info.
  I don`t think it‚Äôs a good idea to have it online exposed especially if you use the same or similar password to all the sites.üò¨ So instead: </p>
<div class="code">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/74c48eeccbd29c00c9147d1e0b99c51b.js"></script>
</div>
<br>
<p><strong>Google/Facebook AOuth2 settings</strong></p>
<p>Now the project is online, but obviously the Google and
  Facebook AOuth won`t work. Setting up the Facebook API especially was a biatch.ü§¨ I spent tons of time to make it happen.
Here is my app`s setting for both google and facebook API.I think it helps a lot to check it over to yours as it does matter
if https, http, www or just url without all these.<br>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9jrni6o3u22bvpz/googleAuth-settings.png?dl=0"><strong>google</strong>   &nbsp;
</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sbg3w9bgj6tlebc/fbAuth1-settings.png?dl=0"><strong>facebook1</strong></a>   &nbsp;
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kdofyacio8yivbb/fbAuth2-settings.png?dl=0"><strong>facebook2</strong></a><br></p>

<p>The call back URL will need to be changed in app.js according to whatever your app`s url is.</p>
<div class="code">

<br>
<p><strong>Multiple Facebook/Google accounts issue</strong></p>
<p>Multiple Facebook/Google accounts unable to register just yet to the website. It will return and interval server error message.
  I spent some time to understand the issue and now I sort of getting it. The problem is the schema and the how mongoDB handling our collection. </p>
<div class="code">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/a6505b84d7be6effb4200807b096514d.js"></script>
</div>
<p>
If a new user register with email and password the username and password will be added to the DB. But if we are using Google/Facebook to log in the username will be empty or null.
Now mondoDB won‚Äôt be happy about it as it will try to skip the partially indexed collections or even refuse to store it.
I`m not 100% sure for the reason for it, but I read something about that it will take memory, so only let one NULL value to be existed in the db.
You can read on it on Spare Indexes, Partial Indexes and Memory Usage in Index Builds. </p>
<p>
I was not completely competent how to overcome this issue and how to change the db`s setup.
There must be a way that you are able to set up mondoDB that this NULL or empty string wouldn`t create this issue. I tried a few things,
I created a random number 1-10000 and made it to a string and every time someone used Google/Facebook Auoth to log in I just popped into the field username:
 ‚Äúgooglelogin‚Äù +  randomNumber so the field won`t be empty. It worked, but I only could log in with two accounts. Gosh!ü§£ The reason is that the random number will remained the same unless
I restarted the app.js.
Of course, it could overcome this adding the const randomNumber somewhere else, so it resets or what, but while I was trying to fix it,
I figured a not elegant, but actually an easy solution for the whole problem. I anyway need to store the googleId or facebookId, so why don`t I just add it to the username section too.
It will be unique and mondoDB won`t have NULL or empty string indexes. It`s working perfectly fine! Not an elegant solution but working!
</p>

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/60c391a4c1a661b4e74cf72e1be58436.js"></script>
</div>
<br>

<p><strong>Users with multiple secret and "empty" secrets</strong></p>
<p>At this point every user only can have one secret. If you try to add a new one it will simply overwrite it.
  If you change the schema from String to Array is a good start. Now we can push the new secret to the array,
  the only problem will be that it won`t occur as separate secrets. On the html site in the ejs we need to call a for each method.
</p>
<div class="code">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/f154445b1d2a870997e6c93d51f446e2.js"></script>
</div>
<p>Now that we are working with an array, thing have changed. We don`t want to display empty or NULL secrets is someone just push submit without
  actually putting anything in the input box. It just doesn`t look good on the screen later on.
  We can do this by either not letting it the app to post it and save it to the array, or just simple don`t let it display it. The issue is:</p>
  <div class="code">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/56878dc07805f91328dfa2c7e924d504.js"></script>
  </div>
<p>Now we can have multiple secrets displayed as separate html without having gaps spamming the screen ruining the flow of texts. </p>
<br>

<p><strong>Delete a secret, not the whole array</strong></p>
<p>We need to be able to separate the specific secret from the array. Splice and resave array! </p>
<div class="code">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ritualjoint/6cd80cb0aa5aea18278e20c9970fa16d.js"></script>
</div>
<br>
<p><strong>Other issues</strong></p>
<p>I covered the basic functions of the app, we have a lot of issues that can arouse still.
   What if someone try to login without actually putting anything in the input box? What if someone will try to log in while already been logged in. Registering twice the same? Unauthorized?
  Bad requests? Etc.  There are not that hard to overcome by these, so I won`t cover it here. I created a few separate ejs files to answer most of this sort of requests,
  so the user knows what‚Äôs going on or in some cases I just simply redirect them to the login page. Not a biggie. Note here, if passport is setup with failureFlash: true
  it will pop up with 400 and 401 errors as flash massages. I just redirect üòâ. You could create another .ejs explaining the problem to the user that the
  username and or the password wasn`t right or the request contained empty string or NULL though. </p>
<p>
  This is just an example, its kinda funny (sort of; annoying af too!) how the issues can spiral. You fix one thing, but you created an other.
  Lets change this, but now this or that not the right place, or just not working. boo! It`s a lot to do with learning this. I guess once I`ll be more familiar how
  to achieve certain things a lot will be a routine based on exparinace. Being new to this, sometimes first you put the plate in the microvawe and once it`s ready you take it out
  putting the food on top and expecting the meal to be worm. I had a lot of like: üòê Hmm, yeah looking back, my expectations and the logic behing it were so off or even plain stupid!
  Daddy chill!
