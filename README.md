Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

While i was studying on udemy we finished a project which i intended to take further as i saw more potential. 
I made a lot of changes to it, added a lot of animation and svg and bamm, here we are now! It took me a bit of effort, 
but completed it. In the about section of the page you can read more about this project, difficulties i 
faced with examples and references. 

I hope you find it useful!

Thank you, code safe! ðŸ’»


ps.: If you want to see the deployment please be patient the inital load time can take 1-3 seconds after that the server will ramp up! :)
