## Hi there 👋

I was doing my self-studies and I felt intrigued to take this project further as by using EJS with MongoDb user could interact with the App. I made a lot of changes to the   <a href="https://github.com/AndrasE/secret-original">original project</a>; added authentications, animations and svgs with navbar and swipe functionalites using hammer.js and themes. It took me a bit of effort, but completed it. In the about section of the page you can read more about this project, difficulties i faced with examples and references.🗒️

I hope you find it useful for your own project!

Thank you, code safe! 💻

ps.: If you want to see the deployment its hosted on heroku eco-tier the server, it might take 2-3s to spin up, please be patient. 🐨
