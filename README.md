## Hi there 👋

While I was doing my self-studies on Udemy I felt intrigued to take a project further as by using EJS with MongoDb user could interact with the App. I made a lot of changes to the original project; added authentications, animations and svgs with navbar and swipe functionalites and themes. It took me a bit of effort, but completed it. In the about section of the page you can read more about this project, difficulties i faced with examples and references. 

I hope you find it useful for your own project!

Thank you, code safe! 💻

ps.: If you want to see the deployment it`s hosted on heroku eco-tier the server,it might take 2-3s to spin up, please be patient. 🐨
